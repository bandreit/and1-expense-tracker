Most of the students start earning money around this time of their life (me included) and so managing their expenses becomes a new challange.
After searching for some good apps to help me manage my money ,
I found out that most of them are built around the idea of the American finance system, a lot of them are subscription based and don't fit my needs.
Getting your head around the Danish tax system is also difficult for the beginners and so the app would try to break it down with a calculator and concrete examples.
